# EpidemicSimulator
Simulates epidemic outbreaks and analyses the resulting data in ways that are interesting in terms of Self Organised Criticality.

This simulator was written by @joakimingman and I during working on our thesis at the Computer Science programme. Its purpose is to simulate the spreading of diseases using cellular automata.

The program is run using one of several predefined rulesets. The simulation can be viewed in real time, set at any speed desired. The visualization can be shut off entirely to maximize simulation seed.

When the simulation is done analysis can be performed on the collected data which in the end gives a PDF showcasing the data and evaluations done on it in ways that are interesting in terms of Self Organised Criticality.
